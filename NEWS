     - PhosphoRS XML import writers and outpout readers
     - DeltaScore calculation when the data is provided
   - Quantification
     - All quantifications can be done now either on the protein level,
       peptide level, or modified peptide level. For modified peptide level,
       supply a matrix with a 'peptide' and 'modif' column to the 
       appropriate functions.
     - Correction of peptide ratios with protein ratios is possible. Also
       the variance can be adjusted (assuming no or full correlation)
   - Report generation
     - Import PhosphoSitePlus or neXtProt information on modification sites

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.0
------------------------
 - Rockerbox import (just define the XXX.dat.peptides.csv as identifications)
 - possibility to define columns for XLS report in properties.R. e.g.
   xls.report.columns <- c("ratio","is.significant",
                           "ratio.minus.sd","ratio.plus.sd",
                           "p.value.ratio","p.value.sample",
                           "log2.ratio","log2.variance")

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.3
------------------------
 - better matching of file patterns of peaklist and id in report
 - tab2xls improvements: 
   - fix when there are cells with preceeding colons - would think they are cell properties
   - fix row limitation of 65536 - add new worksheet with remaining lines
 - re-added ibspiked_set2 dataset as the xz requirement allows for additional data

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.0
------------------------

 - first Bioconductor version (version bump to 1.0.0)!
 - slot name reporterMasses is renamed to reporterTagMasses
    to fix clash with method reporterMasses which fetches assayData(ibspectra)[["mass"]]
 - slot name reporterNames is renamed to reporterTagNames
    to distinguish from deprecated Biobase::reporterNames
 - added option 'scan.lines' to readIBSpectra: read mgf files in parts
    for large MGF files

    properties.conf will be replaced by properties.R

   resulting XML files can be converted to id.csv using psx2tab2.pl
 - prob otion for readIBSpectra worked errornous - fixed (thanks to Xavier Robin)
 - added property use.na: Use NA values for quantification
 - various Analysis Report beautifications (thanks to Xavier Robin)
 - varous bug fixes


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.2.4
------------------------

 - improved Vignette descriptions, added CITATION (still UTF-8 error)
 - added possibility to revert Mascot escaped TITLEs
 - if proteins are excluded w/ subsetIBSpectra, exclude all
   it's peptides, not only reporter-specific ones
 - fix error introduced in 0.2.3: When multiple MGFs were read,
   an false error occured that not all id spectra could be matched
 - add property 'author' for LaTeX reports
 - section 'Significantly regulated proteins' not shown anymore by default
   added property show.significant.proteins to reenable
 - added properties isotope.impurities and fragment.outlier.prob
 - bug fixes: 
   - naming not correct when class labels contain NAs
   - numeric class labels are not handled correctly
 - added naRegion to noise model
 - data is now stored before normalization. Those values are then used to normalize.
   (Thanks to observation of Chris Bielow)

 - specify combination matrix for proteinRatios and in properties.conf
 - improved logging of IBSpectra creation and normalization
 - fix: maplot crashed on all NA channels

------------------------

 - re-added ratio vs intensity plot in QC report
 - issue warning when summarize property is incorrectly defined
 - create cachedir if it does not exist
